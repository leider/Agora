If you want to start from scratch just delete this folder and restart the container.

To browse the databse with `mongo` from the command line you need to connect to the running docker image.
Run `docker exec -it docker_local-mongo_1 bash` to get a bash inside the container.
From there use `mongo swk` to connect to the database.
